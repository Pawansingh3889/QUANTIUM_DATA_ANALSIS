# QUANTIUM_DATA_ANALSIS
CASE STUDY ON SALES OF CHIPS

# Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program
### This repository contains my solution to the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program on Forage.

# Task 1
Data Preparation and Customer Analytics

Conduct analysis on your client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.
We need to present a strategic recommendation to Julia that is supported by data which she can then use for the upcoming category review however to do so we need to analyse the data to understand the current purchasing trends and behaviours. The client is particularly interested in customer segments and their chip purchasing behaviour. Consider what metrics would help describe the customersâ€™ purchasing behaviour.  

To get started, download the resource csv data files below and begin performing high level data checks such as:

Creating and interpreting high level summaries of the data
Finding outliers and removing these (if applicable)
Checking data formats and correcting (if applicable)

You will also want to derive extra features such as pack size and brand name from the data and define metrics of interest to enable you to draw insights on who spends on chips and what drives spends for each customer segment. Remember our end goal is to form a strategy based on the findings to provide a clear recommendation to Julia the Category Manager so make sure your insights can have a commercial application.


# Task 2



To get started use the QVI_data dataset below or your output from task 1 and consider the monthly sales experience of each store. 



This can be broken down by:

total sales revenue
total number of customers
average number of transactions per customer


# Task 3


Use analytics and insights from Task 1 and 2 to prepare a report for the client, the Category Manager.

Used Pyramid Principle method to deliver insigths and recommendation to client in Powerpoint.
